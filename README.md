# iTerm-ssh

iTerm 2 Plugin for Colouring SSH Connections

## Usage

This plugin must be put into the plugin directory with `oh-my-zsh`, this can either be the default one or the custom defined one.

Once it's been put into the correct directory add the plugin name into the **plugin array** in your `.zshrc`. The following are examples of where the files *might* live.

```
ZSH_CUSTOM=~/dotfiles/zsh/custom

plugins=(iTerm-ssh)
```

The above assumes the plugin exists in the following directory: `~/dotfiles/zsh/custom/plugins/iTerm-ssh/iTerm-ssh.plugin.zsh`
